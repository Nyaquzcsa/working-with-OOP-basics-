The main errors in my code were misuse of method. my i was using my defined funtion wrong. i used print instead of just calling my function. 
The other error was to a typo of the constuctor function. (_int__ instead of __init__).

otherwise the code was nearly perfect in its structure.
the other weak point of my code could have been my documentation of every stage of the writing process to improve readability>>
